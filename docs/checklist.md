# Overall Progress

- **Overall completion:** ~27% (Phases 0–2 done)
- **Current phase:** Phase 2 complete → next: Phase 3 (Driver Management)
- **Completed:** Phase 0 (foundation) + Phase 1 (auth/RBAC/users) + Phase 2 (vehicle
  registry CRUD w/ DB-level constraints) — build green, verified against the live DB.
- **Remaining:** Phases 3–10
- **Blocked:** none. DB is live on the user's VPS (isolated `transitops` DB) reached via
  SSH tunnel on local port 55432. Postgres localhost-bound; only the `transitops` role +
  `transitops`/`transitops_shadow` DBs are used — no other VPS project touched.
- **Stack (locked):** Next.js (App Router) + Prisma + local PostgreSQL. Thin route
  handlers → `lib/services/` (business rules R1–R18) → `lib/repositories/` (Prisma).
  No BaaS. Auth via JWT/session; CSV export server-side.
- **DB policy (locked):** Prisma Migrate is primary; use **raw SQL inside migrations**
  for anything Prisma can't express (CHECK, partial unique indexes, triggers, etc.).
  DB must reject invalid data even if the API is bypassed. Rules enforced at UI + API +
  Service + DB.
- **Architecture (locked):** Route Handler (orchestration only) → Service (single source
  of truth for business rules + status transitions + analytics) → Repository (DB ops
  only, no logic) → PostgreSQL. No business logic in routes/repositories; no rule
  duplication across layers.

### Tracked Engineering Assumptions (must stay traceable)
| ID | Assumption | Status | Where implemented |
|----|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| §18-F | ROI Revenue source → add nullable `trips.revenue`, captured on completion; Vehicle Revenue = Σ revenue of Completed trips; ROI = (Revenue − (Fuel + Maintenance)) / Acquisition Cost | ✅ Approved (Option A) | Phase 4 (schema) + Phase 8 (analytics) |
| §18-C | `region` added to vehicles (dashboard filter has no backing field) | ✅ Approved | Phase 2 |
| §18-D | Block opening maintenance on an On-Trip vehicle | ✅ Approved | Phase 5 |
| §18-E | Maintenance cost single source of truth = `maintenance_logs.cost` (no double-count) | ✅ Approved | Phase 6/8 |
| §18-H | License eligible iff `expiry >= today` (inclusive) | ✅ Approved | Phase 3/4 |
| §18-B | Keep Users/Drivers separate; optional nullable `drivers.user_id` | ✅ Approved | Phase 3 |
| §18-A | Both Driver and Fleet Manager may create/dispatch trips | ✅ Approved | Phase 4 |

### How to update this file
1. When you start a task, note it under "Current phase" (only one in progress).
2. When done, tick `[x]`, recompute the phase % = ticked/total in that phase.
3. Recompute Overall % = ticked/total across all phases.
4. Add any newly discovered task as a new unchecked box in the right phase.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

**Standard sub-tracks**
- [x] Database — Prisma tooling + datasource wired (client generates once models land in P1)
- [x] Backend — Next.js server, lazy Prisma singleton, error-handling wrapper
- [x] Validation — zod-based validation layer scaffolded (`lib/validation`)
- [x] APIs — `/api/health` live, returns consistent envelope
- [x] UI — theme tokens, root layout, home shell, shared state components
- [x] Testing — manual smoke test (build green; health/home/404 verified)
- [x] Edge Cases — health degrades gracefully when DB unconfigured/unreachable
- [x] Documentation — README run steps; layer READMEs; docs synced

**Detailed tasks**
- [x] Decide & record tech stack (§18-L) — **Next.js (App Router) + Prisma + PostgreSQL**
- [x] Scaffold Next.js App Router project (`app/`, `lib/services`, `lib/repositories`, `lib/validation`, `lib/http`, `components/ui`)
- [x] Prisma init + `schema.prisma` (datasource → PostgreSQL); models added per phase
- [ ] Set up local PostgreSQL instance (no BaaS) — **BLOCKED: no local Postgres running in env; provision before Phase 1 migrate** (see Blocked)
- [x] DB connection + pooling config via env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, lazy singleton `lib/db.ts`)
- [x] Migration tooling wired up (`prisma:migrate` / `prisma:generate` scripts)
- [x] `.env.example` + secrets kept out of git (`.gitignore` covers `.env*`)
- [x] Base API server + health endpoint (`/api/health` — app + DB reachability)
- [x] Global error-handling middleware + consistent error envelope (`lib/http/*`)
- [x] Request validation layer scaffolding (`lib/validation/index.ts`)
- [x] Frontend routing + layout shell + theme (nav shell + **auth guard → Phase 1** with auth)
- [x] Shared UI states: loading, empty, error (`components/ui/states.tsx`) — **toast → Phase 1** (needs client provider for mutations)
- [x] Consistent theme / color scheme tokens (`app/globals.css`, light + dark)
- [x] README run instructions (setup, migrate, seed, run)
- [x] Verify: `npm run build` green, `npm run typecheck` clean, dev server serves health/home
- [x] Security: patched Next to 14.2.35 (14.2.15 had an advisory)

---

## Phase 1 — Auth & RBAC & Users/Roles ✅

- [x] Database — `roles` + `users` migrated to the transitops DB
- [x] Backend — auth service/repository, JWT (jose), bcrypt hashing
- [x] Validation — zod login/change-password schemas (shared FE+BE)
- [x] APIs — login / logout / me / password, consistent envelope
- [x] UI — login, settings (change password), shell w/ logout, 403, 404
- [x] Testing — full auth flow smoke-tested in dev AND production build
- [x] Edge Cases — generic 401, inactive user, unauth redirect, wrong/weak password
- [x] Documentation — synced; NODE_ENV build trap recorded

**Roles & Users (DB)**
- [x] `roles` table + migration + model
- [x] `users` table + migration + model (FK role_id, unique email)
- [x] Audit fields on both (created_at/updated_at)
- [x] Seed 5 roles: Admin, Fleet Manager, Driver, Safety Officer, Financial Analyst
- [x] Seed initial admin user (creds in gitignored `.env`)

**Backend / Auth**
- [x] Password hashing (bcryptjs, 10 rounds)
- [x] `POST /api/auth/login` (email+password → httpOnly session cookie)
- [x] `POST /api/auth/logout`
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me`
- [x] `PUT /api/auth/password`
- [x] JWT/session issuance + verification (jose, HS256, httpOnly cookie)
- [x] RBAC policy encoded from §3 matrix (`lib/auth/rbac.ts`, deny-by-default) + guards
- [x] Protect all non-auth routes (global `middleware.ts`)

**Validation**
- [x] Email format validation (graceful field-level feedback)
- [x] Password strength/min length (≥8, letter+number)
- [x] Unique email enforcement (DB) + friendly error
- [x] Generic invalid-credentials error (no user enumeration, §16)

**UI**
- [x] Login page + inline validation
- [x] Session-expired handling → redirect to login (`apiFetch` 401 → /login)
- [x] 403 Unauthorized page (`/unauthorized`)
- [x] Logout control (app shell)
- [x] Change-password form (Settings)

**Edge cases (§15)**
- [x] Wrong password / unknown email → 401 generic (verified)
- [x] Inactive user blocked (same generic 401, no enumeration)
- [x] Invalid/expired/missing token → 401 (middleware + guards, verified)
- [ ] Cross-role access attempt → 403 (guard + rbac ready; exercised in Phase 2+ when
      role-restricted resource endpoints exist)

**Testing**
- [x] Login success/failure (verified dev + prod)
- [x] RBAC allow/deny helper (`can()`) — unit-level matrix in place
- [x] Token/session verify (invalid → 401 verified)

**Build note**
- [x] Root layout forces dynamic rendering (authenticated app; no static pages)
- [x] Fixed build trap: removed `NODE_ENV` from `.env` (it forced React dev bundles
      into `next build`, causing prerender crashes). Never pin NODE_ENV in `.env`.

---

## Phase 2 — Vehicle Registry (CRUD) ✅

- [x] Database — `vehicles` migrated with enum, indexes, CHECK constraints
- [x] Backend — vehicle service/repository, layered
- [x] Validation — zod schemas (FE+BE) + DB CHECK backstop
- [x] APIs — full CRUD + available pool + filters/search/sort/pagination
- [x] UI — list, form (create/edit), detail, retire dialog, all states
- [x] Testing — API smoke-tested (CRUD, rules, RBAC, DB backstop) + prod build
- [x] Edge Cases — dup reg no, odometer decrease, retire-on-trip, retired-edit
- [x] Documentation — synced

**Database / Model**
- [x] `vehicles` table + migration
- [x] Fields: reg no, name/model, type, max_load_capacity, odometer, acquisition_cost, status, region 🟨, retired_at, audit
- [x] UNIQUE(registration_number) + normalized-form CHECK (§18-J) — case/space-insensitive
- [x] CHECK capacity>0, odometer≥0, acquisition_cost≥0 (raw SQL in migration)
- [x] CHECK type ∈ allowed set (raw SQL) — DB enforces the closed set
- [x] Status enum VehicleStatus (Available/On Trip/In Shop/Retired)
- [x] Indexes: status, type, region, registration_number
- [x] Model (Prisma)

**Validation**
- [x] Unique reg no (R1) — async FE check + BE re-check + DB unique (all verified)
- [x] Reg-no trim+collapse+uppercase normalization (§18-J) — verified via " mh-12.. "→"MH-12.."
- [x] Numeric ranges (R14) — zod + DB CHECK
- [x] Odometer monotonic non-decreasing on update (R11) — verified 422
- [x] Status: create→Available; only retire changes it here (trips/maintenance in P4/P5)

**APIs**
- [x] `GET /vehicles` (list)
- [x] `POST /vehicles` (create)
- [x] `GET /vehicles/:id` (detail)
- [x] `PUT /vehicles/:id` (update)
- [x] `DELETE /vehicles/:id` (soft delete = Retire)
- [x] `GET /vehicles/available` (dispatch pool, status=Available) — verified 0 after retire
- [ ] `GET /vehicles/:id/operational-cost` — **deferred to Phase 6** (needs fuel+maintenance data)
- [x] Search (reg no + name, case-insensitive)
- [x] Filters (type/status/region)
- [x] Sorting (whitelisted fields via API)
- [x] Pagination
- [x] Duplicate-reg-no validation → 409 (verified, incl. case/space variant)
- [x] RBAC on every endpoint (verified: Driver 403 create/delete, 200 read; FM 201 create)

**UI**
- [x] Vehicle list table
- [x] Search + status/type filters (sort exposed via API; header-sort UI optional/later)
- [x] Create form (inline validation + async reg-no uniqueness check)
- [x] Edit form
- [x] Vehicle detail (info card; history tabs arrive with trips/maintenance/fuel)
- [x] Retire confirm dialog (inline, guarded when On-Trip)
- [x] Empty state
- [x] Loading state
- [x] Error state

**Edge cases (§15)**
- [x] Duplicate reg no (case/whitespace) rejected — verified 409
- [x] Retire an On-Trip vehicle blocked (§7.1) — guard in service + UI disabled
- [x] Decreasing odometer rejected (R11) — verified 422
- [x] DB CHECK backstop: direct invalid SQL insert rejected (regno/capacity/type) — verified

**Testing**
- [x] CRUD smoke tests (create/read/update/retire) — verified
- [x] Uniqueness (case/space) integration test — verified
- [x] Available-pool filter test — verified
- [x] Cross-role RBAC test (Driver vs Fleet Manager) — verified
- [ ] Automated unit/integration test suite — deferred (manual verification done; add
      a test runner in a later hardening pass)

## Newly Discovered Tasks (append as found)
- [x] ~~Provision local PostgreSQL~~ — resolved: isolated `transitops` DB on the VPS via
      SSH tunnel (55432). Migrations run.
- [x] ~~Auth-guarded layout + nav shell~~ — done in Phase 1 (`components/app-shell.tsx`,
      global `middleware.ts`).
- [x] ~~Add `prisma/seed.ts`~~ — done (roles + admin).
- [ ] **Toast/notification provider** (global) — still deferred; Phase 1 uses inline
      form feedback. Add a global toast when broader CRUD lands (Phase 2+).
- [ ] **Deactivated-user login** path is covered by the generic 401, but add an explicit
      admin UI to deactivate users when user-management UI is built (Admin, later phase).
- [ ] **Cross-role 403** end-to-end test — wire once role-restricted resource endpoints
      exist (Phase 2: e.g., Driver cannot POST /vehicles).
- [ ] Revisit remaining `npm audit` items later (fix requires Next 16 major bump —
      deferred to avoid breaking the React 18 setup).
- [x] ~~DB seed of demo users per role~~ — done (fleet/driver/safety/finance demo users,
      `DEMO_PASSWORD` in `.env`); used to verify cross-role 403.

### ⚠️ Build/ops lessons (do not repeat)
- **Never set `NODE_ENV` in `.env`.** It leaks into `next build` and forces React's dev
  bundles into a production build → prerender crashes (`useContext` null, `<Html>`
  import errors). Let Node/Next set it per command.
- **Sandbox already runs a Postgres on `0.0.0.0:5432`** — the VPS tunnel therefore uses
  local port **55432**. Keep the tunnel alive during DB work; `.env` points at 55432.
